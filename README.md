============
Maryland Hiking Trail Filter

This Python project allows you to search through (most) hiking trails in the state of Maryland through a variety of attributes.

###Usage
_Prerequisites: This project requires you to have Python installed on your computer. Download at [http://python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)._

1. [Download the latest file folder](https://github.com/mattgu16/MYPTrails/releases/).
2. Unzip the folder with third party software (or Windows default extracting). _[Not extracting may cause errors in the unicode]_
3. **Remember to keep all of the files in the same folder.**
4. Run main.py

###Notes
- This project _will_ be able to open your default browser to display filtered results. Please make sure your default browser is ***not*** Internet Explorer.
- This version of the project is in beta, and thus is unstable. By the way, there is no current user interface so yeah.  We will keep you posted.
